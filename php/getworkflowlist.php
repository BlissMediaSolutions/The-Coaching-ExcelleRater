/*   Get Workflow List for The Coaching ExcelleRater
     Last Modified Date: 21/9/2018
     version: 1.1
	   1.0 - Initial script created.
			 This script receives a JSON object of the playerid, modeled as:
       {"playerid": x}
			 It then uses RedBean ORM, to return all the Workflows which the player has been allocated.
       It responds with a JSON object, which will be modeled in either of 3 fashions (relative to if the player has been assigned workflows, or an error arises):
       1) [{"id": x, "wfdate": xxxx-xx-xx, "wfname":xxxxx, "coachid":x),
           {"id": x, "wfdate": xxxx-xx-xx, "wfname":xxxxx, "coachid":x)]
       3) {"success": false, "error": xxxxxxxxxx}
    1.1 - Updated script to return formatted date ("Wed, August 29, 2018"), and the fullname of the Coach which created the workflow.  thus result:
       {"id": x, "wfdate": "Wed, August 29, 2018", "wfname":xxxxx, "coachid":x, "coachname": xxxxxxxx),
