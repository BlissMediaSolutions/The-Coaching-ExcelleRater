/*   Get Workflow Results/Stats for The Coaching ExcelleRater
     Last Modified Date: 25/9/2018
     version: 1.0
	   1.0 - Initial script created.
			 This script receives a JSON object of the coachid, modeled as:
       {"coachid": x}
			 It then uses RedBean ORM, to return all the Workflows created by the Coach, which have been completed by Players
       It responds with a JSON object, which will be modeled in either of 3 fashions (relative to if the player has been assigned workflows, or an error arises):
       1) [{"workflowid": x, "wfdate": xxx,xx x xxxx, "wfname":xxxxx, "personid":x, "playername":xxxxxxxx, "totalsocre":x out of x),
           {"workflowid": x, "wfdate": xxx,xx x xxxx, "wfname":xxxxx, "personid":x, "playername":xxxxxxxx, "totalscore":x out of x)]
       3) {"success": false, "error": xxxxxxxxxx}

       N.B: 'TotalScore' is a string, which informs the score the player got, out of the maximum possible score.  for example: '2 out of 6' would signify the
       workflow had 2 videos & the player only scored a total of 2 points across the 2 videos in the workflow
