/*   Save/Add Workflow Results for The Coaching ExcelleRater
     Last Modified Date: 14/9/2018
     version: 1.0
	   1.0 - Initial script created.
			 This script receives a JSON object of the Workflow results, modeled as:
         [{"workflowid": "x", "videoid":"x", "playerid":"x", "answer":"xxxxxx", "score": "x"},
         {"workflowid": "x", "videoid":"x", "playerid":"x", "answer":"xxxxxx", "score": "x"},
         {"workflowid": "x", "videoid":"x", "playerid":"x", "answer":"xxxxxx", "score": "x"}]
       It then uses RedBean ORM, to write this data to the following table: wfanswers;
       It calculates the total score for an individual's workflow, & updates wfteamlist with this total.
       It responds with a JSON object, which will be modeled in either of 2 fashions (relative to if the write was successful, or an error arises):
        {"success": true, "data": xxxxxxxx}
        {"success": false, "data": xxxxxxxxxx}
