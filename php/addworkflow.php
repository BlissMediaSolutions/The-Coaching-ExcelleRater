/*   Save/Add Workflow for The Coaching ExcelleRater
     Last Modified Date: 6/9/2018
     version: 1.0
	   1.0 - Initial script created.
			 This script receives a JSON object of the Workflow, modeled as:
			  [{"name":"Workflow1","date": "2018-08-30","teamid": "1","coachid": "1","resolution":"400x300"},
			 	 {"player1": "2", "player2": "3", "player3": "5", "player4": "6"},
			   {"videoid": "1", "ans1": "54,340", "ans2": "92,563", "ans3": "190,288", "endframe":"show", "playrate": "1", "question": "asdasd"},
			   {"videoid": "2", "ans1": "50,300", "ans2": "92,563", "ans3": "190,288", "endframe":"show1", "playrate": "1.5", "question": "bcsdnd"}]
			 It then uses RedBean ORM, to write this data to the following tables: workflow, wfteamlist, videolist;
       It responds with a JSON object, which will be modeled in either of 2 fashions (relative to if the write was successful, or an error arises):
       {"success": true, "data": xxxxxxxx}
       {"success": false, "data": xxxxxxxxxx}
